                                <p>
                                    All NRE Labs lessons come with lab guides. These are meant to be something you as
                                    the learner
                                    can follow along with so you're not spinning your wheels, wondering what to do with
                                    a lesson.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Many of these guides are written in Markdown, and then rendered as HTML into
                                    the front-end as a readable guide. While these can contain code snippets that can
                                    be automatically executed, it may be useful to embed interactive code right in the
                                    lab guide.
                                    For instance, you may want to execute some code in the left-hand pane where the lab
                                    guide
                                    is located, while looking at the output of a network device or other entity.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Jupyter notebooks are a great tool for accomplishing this, as a lesson author is
                                    able to put executable code snippets right alongside readable text explaining it.
                                    To facilitate their use, NRE Labs optionally allows lesson authors to specify a
                                    jupyter notebook in lieu of a markdown file for use as a lab guide.
                                </p>
                                <h2>How to Use Jupyter Notebooks in NRE Labs</h2>
                                <p>If you encounter a jupyter notebook within a lesson, you might be initially
                                    overwhelmed with the number of buttons and options. Don't worry about that - you
                                    really
                                    only need to know a few key things.</p>
                                <img src="./images/jupyter.png" style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-style: solid;" />
                                <p>This is the toolbar for a jupyter notebook. You'll find this immediately below the
                                    dropdown selector where you can navigate between the labs within a lesson.

                                    The main thing you will use here is the "run" button. This is what allows you to
                                    execute a selected snippet of code. For instance, in the below image, we have a
                                    python snippet embedded in the lab guide. We've selected it, and can execute the
                                    code within using this "run" button:
                                </p>

                                <img src="./images/jupyter_selected.png" style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-style: solid;" />

                                <p>
                                    Depending on the snippet, you might see some output below.
                                </p>

                                <img src="./images/jupyter_output.png" style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-style: solid;" />
                                <p>
                                    Note that you might not get any output. This depends on whether or not the code
                                    being
                                    executed
                                    is meant to produce output, and/or how long it takes to process the instruction.
                                </p>
                                <p> Also note that most jupyter notebooks expect that you'll run all of the snippets in
                                    order.
                                    Not doing this might result in some errors. Just follow the instructions in the lab
                                    guide if you get stuck.</p>

                                <p>Finally, you can edit the contents of a notebook! The text and code provided is just
                                    part of the lab, but the great thing about jupyter notebooks is that you can play
                                    around with them, and download a modified version. </p>

                                <p>Play around with editing the
                                    code provided and running it again! Experiment and learn!</p>
