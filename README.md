# antidote-web

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nre-learning/antidote-web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nre-learning/antidote-web)

This repository is where the web-front end for the Antidote platform is maintained. This is what makes the [NRE Labs](https://nrelabs.io) experience possible, by blending back-end smarts with a sleek, front-end interface.

If you're looking for the back-end services for Antidote, that code is maintained in a separate repository: [`antidote-core`](https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-core).

The [Antidote documentation](https://docs.nrelabs.io/antidote/antidote-architecture) contains additional architectural details
